# Translator

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application for a Google Translator. It provides a simple interface for users to enter text in one language and translate it to another language. The application is built using the Tkinter library in Python.

The project is intended for users who need a quick and easy way to translate text between different languages. It allows users to select the source language and target language using dropdown menus. The application uses the Google Translate API provided by the googletrans library to perform the translation.

Users can enter the text to be translated in the left text box and click the "Translate" button to obtain the translated text in the right text box. The application also displays the selected source and target languages in labeled areas above the text boxes.

Please note that there is commented-out code in the project that uses a different library (googletrans) for translation, but it is mentioned that it does not work properly sometimes. The code using the translate library is the one currently being used for translation.
